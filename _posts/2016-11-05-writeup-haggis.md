## Intro
From 2016-09-30 to 2016-10-02 i, together with the [Ulm Security
Sparrows](https://uss.informatik.uni-ulm.de/) took part in the
[TUM-CTF](https://ctf.hxp.io/) organized by the team h4x0rpsch0rr from
TU Munich. As usual in CTFs there were some challenges and if you
solved one correctly a special flag in form of a binary string appears
from somewhere. This flag can be submitted in the web-interface and
your team gets points.

This post contains my part of the writeup. For the full writeup
please visit the [USS-Blog](https://uss.informatik.uni-ulm.de/?p=492).

## Haggis

The Haggis challenge started with the following greeting:

    OMG, I forgot to pierce my haggisâ€™ sheep stomach before cooking it, so
    it exploded all over my kitchen. Please help me clean up!

    (Fun fact: Haggis hurling is a thing.)

    nc $IP $PORT

Connecting to the port yielded some hex-code.
There was also a file attached with the following content:

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, binascii, struct
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

pad = lambda m: m + bytes([16 - len(m) % 16] * (16 - len(m) % 16))
def haggis(m):
    crypt0r = AES.new(bytes(0x10), AES.MODE_CBC, bytes(0x10))
    return crypt0r.encrypt(len(m).to_bytes(0x10, 'big') + pad(m))[-0x10:]

target = os.urandom(0x10)
print(binascii.hexlify(target).decode())

msg = binascii.unhexlify(input())

if msg.startswith(b'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\0') \
        and haggis(msg) == target:
    print(open('flag.txt', 'r').read().strip())
{% endhighlight %}

This was most probably the code running on the server. Let's look at
it step by step.
There is a padding defined which takes a message as input and pads it
such that its length is a multiple of 16 Bytes. If one byte is
missing, it adds a one, if two bytes are missing it adds two twos. If
three bytes are missing it adds three threes. And so on. If the
message is already a multiple of 16 Bytes, it adds 16 16s to the end.
So there is one whole block of padding at the end.

The function haggis takes a messages and computes some kind of
CBC-MAC. It prepends the length of the message. This length fills one
whole block. Then comes the message itself together with the padding
to make the length a multiple of the block size of the cipher.
All of this is encrypted with the AES-cipher in CBC mode. The key used
is 0x10, the initialization vector is set to zero. This is not in the
code, but it can be found in the documentation that this is the
default.
The function haggis returns the last encrypted block. This block
depends on all of the previous blocks because that is the way CBC
works.

The code then chooses a random target, which is encoded in hex and
printed. It waits for an incoming msg which is hex-decoded.
If msg starts with the string 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no
good.\0' and if haggis(m) yields the target then the flag is
printed.

So our task is pretty clear: For a given target we need to find a msg where
haggis(msg)==target and msg needs to start with 'I solemnly swear that
I am up to no good.\0'.

To solve this challenge, remember how CBC works.
CBC splits the input in blocks $$P_i$$ of equal length and computes
$$C_i=E(C_{i-1}\oplus P_i)$$, where $$\oplus$$ is the xor operator.
$$C_0$$ by the way is the initialization vector.
We can decrypt a single block, since we know the key. It was just
0x10.
To make things easier, we restrict some variables such that we have
fewer choices to make. We know that our msg needs to start with 'I
solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\0'. Let us append 'aaaaaa' to
make this a multiple of the block size. Next comes a block
further referred to as mojo which we will choose in a very special way.
The final block consists of the padding. It is one block full of
padding, so in Python it looks like this:
b'\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10'.
Then we already know the length of the whole plaintext, namely 64
Bytes which we can prepend. All in all, we get the arrangement shown in
the image.

![Graphical Explanation of our Forgery]({{ site.url }}/assets/writeup-haggis/haggis.png)

Note the only part of the plaintext which is not fixed is the block
containing the mojo. This mojo contains the whole magic of the forgery of
the MAC. Regarding the ciphertext for the most part we do not care,
except for the last block. This should be the target we receives from
the server. So we can consider it as fixed.

How can we find a suitable mojo?
We can trace the target backwards through the CBC. For sake of
notation, let $$n$$ denote the last block, so $$C_n=target$$. We can decrypt
$$C_n$$ such that we end up on top of the last block. Xoring with the
padding yields $$C_{n-1}$$. If we decrypt $$C_{n-1}$$ with a single
round of AES and xor it with $$C_{n-2}$$ then we get the mojo.
But what is $$C_{n-2}$$? To compute this, we can start from the left
hand side and encrypt with CBC. It happens to be the CBC encryption of
the blocks up to then, i.e., the encryption of the string 'I solemnly
swear that I am up to no good.\0aaaaaa'.
And that is already everything.

There were some programming issues with AES objects in CBC-mode being
stateful, which we did not expect and was a source of confusion.
We did not talk to the IP with Python, but instead copied the given
target from Netcat into an ipython. There we computed the dehaggised
target and copied it into our NetCat process.
This yielded the flag.
