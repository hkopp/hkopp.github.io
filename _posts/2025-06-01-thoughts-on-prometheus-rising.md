Usually, I do not post book reviews, but recently I read Prometheus
Rising by R.A. Wilson and feel that i need to write down some thoughts
on it, so I do not have to read the book again in the future, but can
still refer to the ideas. This is not a summary of Prometheus Rising,
but rather a retelling and an interpretation by me. If you are
interested in the book, go buy the book.

First of all, books have always been very influential in shaping my
thinking and my view of the world.
Books lead me to appreciate engineering as a child ("The way things
work" by David Macaulay), study math (Martin Gardner and Ian Stewart),
learn coin magic (Bobo), and start meditation (Brad Warner).
However, it has been some time that i have read a book that truly
changes the way i think about the world.
And then i encountered Prometheus Rising by R.A. Wilson.

## Background
In my view of the world there is a single objective reality, and all
individuals perceive this single reality through their individual
sensation-filters. This is similar to Kant's theory of mind
(Verstand), but I do not know enough Kant to be certain. As an
example, while the concrete sensations when perceiving the color red
can differ between various individuals, there is still an objective
color red, defined as some part of the visible spectrum of light
(see also the debate around [qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia)). 

After reading Prometheus Rising I am not so sure anymore. This book
showed me that individual realities differ far more than i have
expected.

## Thinker and Prover
According to Wilson, the human brain can be conceptually divided into
two parts: the thinker and the prover.
The purpose of the thinker is to think of something. The purpose of
the prover is then to rationalize this thought to fit in the worldview
of the subject.

> Whatever the thinker thinks the prover proves.

As an example, a person may think that immigrants are criminal. Then
the prover will find evidence for this thought and will discard
evidence that does not support this belief (see also [confirmation
bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)).

So how does generation of knowledge by science work? First, it seems
that it does not work at all under such a model, but Wilson offers a
solution: As science is a collective endeavor, the individual biases
are averaged and what emerges is consensus-reality. This neatly
explains why individual scientists sometimes hold very irrational
beliefs.
[Alfred Wegener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener) was
mocked for his continental drift theory, which is now widely
accepted by mainstream geology.
[Isaac
Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Isaac_Newton)
held some beliefs about god that would currently be considered
very irrational.
In Prometheus Rising it is explained that Einstein rejected the
emerging quantum physics ("God does not play dice"). This is an
oversimplification and probably a misrepresentation. But still, it
does not invalidate the main argument.

## Reality Tunnels
This dynamic of Thinker and Prover leads to individuals developing and
living in vastly different realities which Wilson calls reality
tunnels: The communist, the Jehova's witness, the catholic, etc. But
there is also consensus-reality.

As an example, let us talk about UFOs.
There have been many reports about UFO sightings or even [alien
abductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction).
To the **ufologist**, these are real events that have really
happened. To the **psychologist** these events have also happened, but not
in an external reality, but as a subjective experience, as part of the
collective unconscious. The psychologist's prover says that a
recurring theme of alien abduction are forced medical examinations,
often involving reproductive systems.
These similarities point to unsolved thoughts revolving around sexual
shame.
Further, alien abductions often involve [the same or at least very
similar steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_of_the_abduction_phenomenon).
This is further proof for the subjective experience of alien
abductions.
To the **rationalist**, UFOs and alien abductions are a symptom of
mental illness such as schizophrenia.

In consensus-reality UFOs and alien abductions do not exist.
If governments would release evidence for the existence of UFOs and
aliens, this would destabilize the reign of religion.
This is similar to the [Copernican
Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution),
i.e., the paradigm shift from a reality with the earth in the middle
of the solar system to a heliocentric system, in which the planets
revolve around the sun at their center.
Here also, the influence of religion was endangered and society was
destabilized.

> What the thinker thinks, the prover proves.

Consensus-reality needs to be enforced in order to protect the
stability of the society. This is also the cause of the taboo against
homosexuality or children born outside marriage.

## Architects
If we compare our consensus-reality to the apparently more extreme
realities of the ufologist or of someone in the cult of [Jim
Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones), then we have to admit
that our reality tunnels are not anymore plausible.

> We are bigger architects than we think.

Each of us is constantly constructing our own reality. Everything that
we think/live/experience has been constructed by us. We think our
reality and we prove our reality.

And this is one of the parts, where Prometheus Rising has opened my
eyes. Previously I thought that there is sensory perception untainted
by thought and hence by the individual reality tunnel. The Buddha was
sitting under the Bodhi tree until all his imprints fell away, and at
that moment, he became enlightened. At that moment, he disembarked his
reality tunnel and saw thoughts as thoughts.
In my understanding after reading Prometheus Rising, even the
perception is tainted by the individual reality tunnel. If you are
poor, you will not perceive shrimp canapes or other luxurious food. If
you are living in a large city, you will not perceive nature, as you
will simply not encounter it that much. And you will rationalize that
reality to yourself. If you are reading this, look around you. What
decisions did you make that lead to this reality that you are now
perceiving?

## Changing Reality Tunnels
A part of Prometheus Rising is about changing reality tunnels.
Wilson calls it metaprogramming, but i would rather prefer the term
"testing the limits of reality".
In the book the example of [Patty
Hearst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Hearst) is given, which
was the daughter of a publishing magnate. She was living in her
capitalist reality tunnel, where people are driving too large cars and
smoking too big cigars. Then she was kidnapped by the militant left
Symbionese Liberation Army and subsequently entered their reality
tunnel. She even participated in a bank robbery.

Similar to Patty, we can also change our reality tunnels, though we
could start less drastically. We could try to adopt the belief "every
day is just a little bit better than the last" or "everybody likes
me". We are constantly constructing our own reality.
I am not sure if we are in the territory of pseudoscience here. Wilson
does not say exactly that it works, but rather that we should try for
ourselves what happens.

## Conclusion
I guess this time there is no conclusion. I do not really know how to
end this blog post. I have left you with some half-baked ideas, but
that is how i experienced that book. Usually I am the one
choosing a book and asking questions and expecting answers and knowledge.
This time, as with all good books, it was the other way around. The
book left me with a lot of questions.

What distinguishes me and my processes of insight from, say a disciple
of Jim Jones? These people could have been considered normal, before
slowly abandoning consensus reality.

Which Copernican Revolution is the next one? I.e., which parts of
knowledge that are currently widespread and influential will turn out
to be wrong 500 years from now on?

And finally, since there are no Bodhi trees here in Blue Rock city
where i live, where would the Buddha sit, if he was in my reality
tunnel?
