This is a travel report about my trip to St. Imiere to commemorate the
150th anniversary of the first Anti-authoritarian International.
The back story is that 150 years ago Bakunin held its congress there
which marks the separation between the communist and the anarchist
movement.

The trip was an autonomously organized camp with lots of workshops and
concerts. Everyone could propose a workshop or support spontaneously.
Instead of complaining that the lines at the food distribution were
too long, one could volunteer to distribute food by oneself. Thus,
there was no clear separation between producer and consumer as is
usually the case in our society.

All prices were so-called "suggested prices", which means that you
could pay more or less. The people there did not care that much about
money. The camping site was extremely clean and quiet and could not be
compared at all to the camp sites at metal festivals which are usually
full of dirt and drunk people partying the whole night.

My first workshop was about activist climbing. At the introduction
round everyone had to say its pronouns which felt really weird to me.
Then, you should not say [Prusik knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusik_knot),
because Prusik was a nazi. Instead we called it a caterpillar.
One of the goals of the climbing was to make it as cheap as possible,
so everyone could participate. Consequently, there was not much else
than two caterpillars and a [figure eight
descender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_8_(climbing)). This
made it very tedious and did not feel as secure as the [Grigri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigri)
I was accustomed to. 
I wondered if i was really at the correct place. There were a lot of
workshops about feminism, queerness, and related topics. These are
not my activist struggles.
I care about animal rights, cheap living space, open source software,
Assange support, Black Metal, privacy technologies, criticism of
surveillance capitalism, criticism of consumerism, making home-made
jam instead of buying some overpriced capitalist sugar-shit, ....

I was planning to leave the next day, but then I got into a
conversation with my neighbor at the camping ground. He was able to
cheer me up, as he also had different struggles. He was a punk.
Currently he was working at medieval fairs. During the corona years he
lived in a rainbow community in Colombia that had problems with theft.
Any time someone wanted to expel a thief from the community, some
hippie shielded the thief as expelling was against the rainbow ideals.
This brought down the whole community.

All in all, the people were extremely intelligent and had stimulating
views on life. It was easy to get into a conversation, especially when
waiting in a queue or volunteering for a shift.

There was a workshop on anti-authoritarian money. Money solidifies power
structure and the open question was if that always has to be the case.
In the other hand, money is a comparatively cheap way to settle
ownership disputes.
My friends from university who were also doing research on
blockchains would have had fun. (I'm thinking of you, Ketzu.)
Another question was how a collective should handle money that it
receives from outside by selling products. If you, dear reader, want
to go down that rabbit hole, start reading about value networks or
gift economy.

One workshop was held by the Anarchist Black Cross of Moscow. This is
a prisoner support organisation that currently supports a lot of the
political prisoners that protest against the Ukraine war. One
interesting point for me was, that prisoner's support is a low-risk
form of activism, and was not declared illegal even in stalinist
times. Also interesting to note is that according to the Black Cross
funding lawyers is not unnecessary, even though they cannot change the
outcome of a process, as the lawyers may be the only ones allowed to
speak to the prisoners and thus they are necessary for staying in
contact with them.

At some workshops nobody organized them. This was only apparent after
20 minutes in. It was very interesting to see how the people then
started organizing themselves. Sometimes this worked, e.g., at the
singing workshop. Sometimes this kind of failed.
At the workshop about wild practices, we decided to do some
stretching. We stood in a circle and everyone had to suggest a
movement which then all of us have to do. One movement was howling
like a wolf and stretching. It was like a dream of some weird
experimental educator. Before everyone had their turn, i asked my
neighbor to go into the woods and do a walk and share some skills.
This idea was picked up by the others and we walked into the nearby
forest and had some discussions and skillsharing. Then, some people
decided they wanted to build a [bow
drill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_drill) to start a fire. I and
a guy from Britain did not think that this would work, but neither of
us wanted to be the arrogant negative guy standing around, so we just
watched the others and talked. Of course, the bow drill never worked.

There was a workshop about psychedelic substances on the question
of legalisation, decriminalization, or communalization.
The question was if a legalization would lead to psychedelic
substances being fed into the capitalist machine and the creation of
precarious work and how that could be prevented.
Currently, the creation of psychedelics works like growing tomatoes on
a porch, or like sharing cooking recipes.
"Share it, don't sell it", was something we could agree on.

Another highlight for me was the book fair. There was everything from
large publishers to some hobby projects of people that printed some
zines in their back yard. I was very impressed that the people were
more concerned with making their ideas known than with making money.
Again, most of the prices were just suggested.
Special shout-out to the anarcho-nihilist Belgians from the post
office distro.

All in all, it was great. Five of five stars. Would do again.
I really got some impulses for life and thinking about society and
money in a different way that will nourish me for a long time.
Special thanks to the organizers and all the people who made that
event possible. Thanks to all the people for the nice discussions.
