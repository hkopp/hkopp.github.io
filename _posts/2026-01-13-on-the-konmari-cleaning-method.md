## Introduction

I am probably a minimalist without ever wanting to be one.
I prefer to own few things of high quality instead of multiple items of low or mediocre quality.
But I have never purposefully engaged with keeping order and was never interested in cleaning or decluttering.
My parents always had trouble in convincing me to clean my room.

But i looked into related topics to decluttering such as [anti-consumerism]({% post_url 2023-08-05-culture-industry %}) and Epicureanism.
I was interested in how advertisements overshadow the true desire and plant artificial desires.
When i look around me, all these items that I own tell a story of my previous decisions.
And when you look around, dear reader, it is the same.
Hence, I am mindful in what items i choose to surround me with.

Nevertheless, I never looked into decluttering systems such as [Swedish death
cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_death_cleaning)
or the [KonMari system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo).

So I was delighted to find a copy of the book
*The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up*
by Marie Kondo 
in one of those communist bookshelves.

![Of course, I have the German version]({{ site.url }}/assets/2026-01-13-on-the-konmari-cleaning-method/the_book.jpeg)

Marie Kondo is a famous decluttering coach who has created her own
system.
According to the book itself, she was possessed by decluttering as a
child.
I even suspect that she is not neurotypical.
She has made her made her passion to her job.
Her approach is slightly esoteric and inspired by Shinto.

Being Japanese, some of her advice does not fit completely my
situation.

I read her book in half a week, as it is very easy to read.
And now i will present the main points, so I do not have to read it
again and you can also save yourself the time.


## The KonMari System

The goal of the KonMari system is to be surrounded only by items that
spark joy.

For this, there are two necessary steps that have to be done in
exactly that order:

1. **Decluttering.** Throw away what does not spark joy.
2. **Organizing.** All items of the same category should be at the same place.

It is recommended to declutter everything in a short timespan instead
of little by little.
This way, the tidy home is so overwhelming that you never need to
repeat this process again, as it will simply stay decluttered
according to Mrs. Kondo.

One should declutter not room by room but according to categories,
such as clothing, books, etc.
For this, everything of one category should be put on a pile.
Then, each object should be held in the hand and it should be felt
whether it sparks joy or not.
Then, the object should be either kept or you let go of it.

You should not listen to music when doing this, as this will disrupt
the conversation between your heart and the objects.
After a while, you will develop intuition on what makes you happy, and
what items you want to surround you with.

It is important to hold each object in your hands, even photos and
books. You cannot decide whether a book makes you happy by just
looking at it, without taking it in your hand.

When giving it away, you should thank the objects.
As an example, you can say "Thanks for keeping my feet warm and safe during all
those hikes we did together" to your hiking boots.
Even if you never used an item it probably sparked joy during the
shopping. Or if it was a gift that you did not like, you can say
"Thanks, for coming into my life".
Only after this, you can give it away.
It is always the same cycle: **acknowledging the purpose of the object,
thanking it, and then letting go**.

Another recommendation is to never show your family what you plan to
declutter.
Otherwise, they will become woeful when they see your old souvenirs
from vacations, or your old child toys.

When organizing, it is recommended to also thank the objects.

One life-hack is to roll T-shirts and tops, instead of stacking them.
When you stack them, you always wear the top three and do not even see
the lower ones.
When traveling, I already do this and it is great to be able to
access all shirts directly.
Mrs. Kondo thinks that the upper clothing presses on the lower
clothing, and hence the lower clothing is not happy with the
situation.

## Conclusion

The big question is, if i used this method to declutter my living
situation.
Of course not. But I will. Probably. Some day.

I am quite happy with how I am living. Most of the
recommendations I already implement.
I have given away some board games previously. Not because I do not
like them, but because they remind me of my ex-girlfriend and her
highly competitive way of playing and trying to put me down.

I only have few of the objects that are mentioned in the book,
such as bags, or cosmetic samples. I also do not own that much
clothing. Probably, I am not the target group of the book. Well, I did
not buy the book to begin with.

Still, I agree with the main part of living an attentive live.
Do not get me wrong. I do not care, whether people have lots of stuff
or little.
But I highly welcome when people are mindful of the objects that they spend their time with.
