# Introduction

This is an explanation of (and a rant about) the culture industry.
Originally the notion of culture industry is due to Adorno and
Horckheimer, two Jews who fled Nazi Germany.
Then in America they wrote the book "Dialectic of Enlightenment" which
was publicized in 1947, where they criticize the uniformity of American
culture.
Unfortunately that book is hard to read, so i decided to explain their
concept of culture industry in layman's terms.

Culture industry is about pop culture. This type of culture is not
created by ordinary people, but concerns cultural products that are
marketed via mass media and then advertised towards mass consumption.
Ordinary people only consume pop culture and are not a part their
creation.

Every product of that culture is a similar bleak commodity that is cut
into standardized chunks for marketing, advertising, and distribution.
It has no artisanal value or individuality.
The only goal of the culture industry that produces culture products
is profit. Thus, no risks are taken and the same repetitive content is
spewed out that lulls people into complacency.

# Contemporary Culture Industry
Even though the term was coined in the 1940s, it is easy to find
contemporary examples, as the same capitalist mechanisms that produced
this phenomenon persist.

Take movies as an example. Current movies in cinemas are series,
spin-offs of a series, or reboots.
Take a look at "Game of Thrones" or "Lord of the Rings", or "Star
Wars" with its myriads of movies. Take a look at the whole American
superhero genre.
All movies have the same structure and no creator takes risks anymore.

The same happened with music. All pop songs converge on the same
structure and the same few chords.
This product is then marketed towards the masses.
And each new pop song copies an old pop song thus creating a huge
amount of songs that have no artistic goal or expression.
This is the case even in niches.
Listen to some Iron Maiden. They have found what their fans like and
now they produce song after song after song that is a copy of a copy
of a copy.
Note that this is a case where capitalism actively prevents progress.

The culture industry in music consists of a few large records labels.
And the same is true for movies, where only few large players control
the market completely.

# Culture Industry on the Internet
The huge chance of the internet was a democratization of the
production of cultural products, as the obstacles to creating an own
website were small in the beginning.
This is not the case anymore.
Small websites are simply not discoverable and thus stay hidden.
There are only a few large web sites that everyone visits and they are
full of the same bleak, lifeless content.

Even on Youtube where supposedly any individual can become a content
creator the content has become vain.
No risks are taken by the creators in order to not lose followers.
Thus, the content becomes repetitive.
There are no real controversies, only fake drama, click-bait titles,
and provocative thumbnails in order to foster engagement.

This is not a problem with the individual content creators.
Rather, the incentives for producing content are skewed such that this
development will take place.
Youtube has established a technocratic system through their
recommendation algorithm where content is maximized towards engagement
in order for the content creators to receive some likes and increase
their viewer numbers.

# Psychological Control by Capitalism
The control of the culture industry extends beyond only the culture
products into the psychological realm.
We are free to consume as we wish, but not to create as we wish.
Only standardized forms of entertainment exist that will not subvert the
Status Quo.

The culture industry takes our dissatisfaction with the Status Quo and
sells that back to us in their products.
These cultural products include symbols of rebellion and insurrection.
Examples for where that is the case include Batman's Joker or the
movie Fight Club.

This gives us the feeling that we participate in those emotions.
Thus, we do not have to act on our feelings of dissatisfaction.
The consumer is rendered docile and domination of the culture industry
is maintained.

## Case Study: Triangle of Sadness
This is a movie that was recommended to me by a colleague of mine.
It is about high society people on a yacht and their idiosyncratic
behaviors.
In one scene an old rich lady asks the captain to clean the sails. The
captain answers that this is a motorboat and that there are no sails.
Then the lady asks her husband if that is correct and (if i remember
correctly) he also says that there are sails.
Thus, the movie slightly mocks rich people and their detachedness from
the world.

But actually the movie received a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film
Festival. And you know who gave this movie the Palme d'Or? The same
champagne-drinking yacht people that the movie wants us to believe it
is mocking.
The movie is watched by exactly those people it is supposed to
criticize.

## Case Study: Deadpool
Deadpool is the 8th movie of the X-Men series which at the time of
writing consists of 13 movies. This already shows that no risk was
taken in the production of that movie.
The start of the movie is a parody of an opening credits scene with
supposedly funny credits such as "some douchebag's film", "starring
god's perfect idiot", or "a CGI character".

Probably this is supposed to appear edgy. We should think that some teens
had the opportunity to put that in the movie to make a statement about
the people who made it.
But actually these credits were written by the same rich dudes driving
too large cars that write every Hollywood movie.
Nothing about that is subversive.

# Summary
The culture industry produces culture products with the only goal of
mass production.
They produce only for profit without taking any risks.
There is no artistic goal. The only goal is to make money.

The consumers are lulled into complacency and as a result art
does not matter anymore.
