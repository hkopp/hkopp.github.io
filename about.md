I studied math and did my PhD in a mix of cryptography, computer security, and privacy.
I am currently working as a so-called security consultant, as that sounds way more professional than "hacker".
My other interests include music and sailing.

If you want to contact me, you can write me at hkopp22 (at) yahoo (dot) de.
